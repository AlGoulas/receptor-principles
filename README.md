# Organizational principles of receptor distribution in the human brain
Uncover receptor principles of the human brain with data mining

The code performs a series of multivariate stats, dimensionaltiy reduction, machine learning (support vector regression) analysis to gain insights into the organization of 15 different types of receptors in the human brain.

Receptor density data are acquired via histological proceissing of human tissue (quantitative receptor autoradiography)
